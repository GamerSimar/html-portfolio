                    <h1>3D and HD Era Games</h1>
                    <p>I first completed Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. This was the first time I had ever completed a GTA game. Some missions were hard to complete and some were not, other GTA games I completed later were not as hard as GTA SA. This is one of the reasons I was able to complete them so easily. However, this only applys to the 3D era games.</p>

                    <p>I then completed GTA Vice City. Although this was not the second game I played, I gave more  time and dedication to this one. This is the reason why I was succesful in completing GTA VC first. GTA VC was an okay game and was a downgrade from games I was used to but is still a classic. I then completed GTA III which is just a meh game. GTA LCS is far from that, the second GTA game I played. One of the more tedious ones, I might add. I absolutely love this game and think this is really underrated.</p>

                    <p>GTA IV and GTA V were whole new games to perfect. I had a lot of fun with GTA V online and probably think it is one of the better online modes rockstar has made. GTA V had a really good gameplay aspect which I also loved. You can do anything in it, GTA V is also the best graphically. GTA IV, which is the last game I have completed, has the best story and is probably one of the best GTA games ever made. Every aspect that 3D era games had that was unrealistic was made realistic. I absolutely love GTA IV and I think it is perfectly rated.</p>

                    


                    <p>The stories games were played seperately. I have only played all of the stories games but have not completed them 100%. The two games I am talking about arer GTA Liberty City Stories and GTA Vice City Stories. GTA LCS was the second GTA game I played and I have a special spot for it. It's a good game not much to say about it. In GTA VCS, I was finally able to swim around Vice City. It had a bit of a complex story and was a little bit all over the place. However, I still enjoyed playing it. I do think LCS is better though.</p>

                    <p>I played the 3D era games on PC. The HD era games were played on PC and PS4. GTA IV being on PC while GTA V being on PS4. These games were also 100% completed which took an extravagant amount of time.</p>
