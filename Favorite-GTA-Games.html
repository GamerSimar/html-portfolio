    <p class="size">I put GTA IV at 1 as it is widely regarded as the greatest 
      GTA of all time. It has the best story, physics, characters. 
      If GTA IV was remade it would sell more than GTA V in my opinion.
      GTA San Andreas has the best gameplay, a great story, the most
      customizable your player ever was. This includes clothes, tattos,
       and even body types like fat, skinny, or muscular. GTA San Andreas
      also arguably has the best GTA modding community too so it adds even
      content to the game. It also has the best 100% completion reward with 
      a tank and jet spawning outiside of your main safehouse, infinite ammo,
       and $1 million. GTA V is the newest in the series and yet 10 years old.
       It has the best graphics, 3 playable characters, best cars, best online
       mode which still gets updated to this day. The only thing that seperates
       GTA V from GTA SA is the lack of rewards for completion, not too fun activities
      after story, basic customizations like clothing and haircuts only.
      These things defenitely put it below GTA SA.
