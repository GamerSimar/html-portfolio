            <h1>How to mod older GTA Games</h1>  
        <p>Modding GTA games is really easy. The first thing is getting modloader and cleo. Once installing these 2 mods, you can drop files folders created in the modloader which it will load. Some recomended mods are Silent Patch and Widescreen Fix.</p>

            <h1>How to beat the older GTA games</h2>
            <p>The older GTA games are pretty straight-forward to beat. However, there is one big exception, to beat GTA Vice City, you need to buy a lot of properties and need to buy the printer machine property. Then the rest of the game is pretty straight-forward, just complete all of the missions.</p>

            <h1>What to do after beating the GTA games</h3>
            <p>Most of the time, when you beat a GTA game, you 100% complete it. That is what I will tell you to do here.</p>

            <h1>Look up a <em>guide</em></h4>
            <p>looking up a guide is very easy and can tell you what to do in order to beat the game.</p>

            <h1>Check your game Percentage</h4>
            <p>Checking your game <strong>percentage</strong> can get you to know how much of the game you have completed. Checking your stats and cross referencing with the 100% checklist is also a good way to do so.</p>

            <h1>GTA Games to get</h1>
            <p>Here are some GTA games you should consider buying.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>GTA Vice City</li>
                <li>GTA San Andreas</li>
                <li>GTA III</li>
                <li>GTA IV</li>
                <li>GTA V</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is the order I recomend you playing the GTA games as it helps you understand the lore better, however, some story elements may contradict one another.</p>
